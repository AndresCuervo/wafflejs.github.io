About
-----
WaffleJS is a monthly meetup centered around programming, waffles, and karaoke.
It started when Visnu and Billy went to [BrooklynJS][1]. They were inspired by
the event and wanted to organize a Bay Area technology meetup that would do
these things:

- Have attendees actually meet and talk to one another.
- Promote a diverse and inclusive environment.
- Get people to have fun.

Today the meetup is co-organized by [Visnu][@visnup], [Billy][@billyroh], [Kelly][@kng], [Emily][@nexxylove] and [Myles][@thealphanerd].
It's held at [SoMa StrEat Food Park][2] every first Wednesday of the month.

History

The first session was in August 2015 and it has been held monthly ever since.
We use funds to cover the cost of food, the venue, and equipment. We donate
all unused funds each month to [Girls Who Code][1], a non-profit that
encourages more women to enter STEM fields.

Speakers & Attendees
--------------------
Our past speakers have worked as developers at established companies, as well
as smaller startups. Here are a few of those companies:

- Google
- Mozilla
- Dropbox
- Square
- Stripe
- npm

Our attendees are roughly the same ratio of people from larger and smaller
companies, leaning toward smaller startups. Around 35% of our attendees are
women.

Diversity
---------
We believe this industry can and should be more inclusive. Here are the things
we do to make that happen:

- **Donations:**
  We donate all proceeds to Girls Who Code, a non-profit that encourages more
  women to enter the STEM field.
- **Student sponsorships:**
  We sponsor students to come to the event so they can meet more people in the
  industry. So far, we’ve had students from Hackbright and Hack Reactor.
- **Diverse speakers:**
  We make sure that we have a wide range of speakers at each of our events,
  with an eye toward gender, racial, and socioeconomic diversity.
