Speaker FAQs
-----

#### What's WaffleJS?
WaffleJS is a monthly meetup centered around programming, waffles, and karaoke.

#### How do I submit a talk?
You can either comment on [this issue][1] or [send us an email][2].

#### When and where will it be?
When: Wednesday, January 6 from 7 to 10 PM.

Where: Soma StrEat Food Park

#### Do I need to be an expert to talk?
Nope. This meetup is supposed to be fun and casual, so we want everyone to participate. We especially encourage people of underrepresented groups to apply.

#### What kind of talks are you looking for?
We don't have a strict formula, but this is the balance we try to strike every month:
* **2x Creative Talks**: Creative applications of programming. Past examples are generating lego murals out of static images, and building an in-browser RPG.
* **1x Passion Talk**: Something you're excited about outside of work. Past examples are starting and maintaining an open source project, and using meditation and programming side by side.
* **1x Technical Talk**: A deep dive on a technical topic. Past examples are optimizating your code for the V8 JavaScript engine, and using functional programming for developing UI.

#### How long should my talk be?
Ten minutes. There won't be any formal Q&A.

#### What should be in my talk submission?
Just a few sentences describing what you want to talk about would be great.

#### What's the A/V situation?
We'll have a projector (with HDMI) and a mic for you to use. Let us know if you need any fancy adapters (we'll have some Apple ones).

#### Do I need to submit my slides beforehand?
Nope, but please show up at least 30 minutes before your talk.
