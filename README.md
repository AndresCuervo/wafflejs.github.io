  * 🎉 🐱 ✨ or: How I didn't fix emoji in Chrome with [Monica Dinculescu][@notwaldorf]

* _🔖_ _8:10 PM · Speaker_

* _🙏_ _8:35 PM · Speaker_
  * Zen and the Art of Coding with [Jeanie Chung][@jeanieshark]
  * We've all heard some woo-woo stuff about zen and "finding your center." How can we integrate some mindful practices into our coding and the way we relate to our coworkers? Maybe there's some value to this namaste shit after all.
