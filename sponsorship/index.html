    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>WaffleJS is a monthly meetup centered around programming, waffles, and karaoke. It started when Visnu and Billy went to <a href="http://brooklynjs.com">BrooklynJS</a>. They were inspired by the event and wanted to make a meetup that would do these things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Have attendees actually meet and talk to one another.</li>
      <li>Promote a diverse and inclusive environment.</li>
      <li>Get people to have fun.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Today the meetup is co-organized by Visnu, Billy, and Kelly, and hosted by Visnu and Emily. It’s held at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/0gkOe">SoMa StrEat Food</a> Park every first Wednesday of the month.</p>

      <li><b>Student sponsorships:</b> We sponsor students to come to the event so they can meet more people in the industry. So far, we’ve had students from Hackbright and Hack Reactor.</li>
      <li><b>Diverse speakers:</b> We make sure that we have a wide range of speakers at each of our events, with an eye toward gender, racial, and socioeconomic diversity.</li>
