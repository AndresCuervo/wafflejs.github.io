          the pieces that are properly colored (if the polyhedron shape is
          treated as a graph). Graph coloring, the four color map theorem, and
          modular origami.

          HTTP to TLS) as well as how major vendor support led to the default
          use of https when working with HTTP/2 sites.

          and bad financial decisions with this one weird trick! Since you’re
          coming to a JS meetup in San Francisco, chances are that you are an
          engineer working for a startup. This talk will cover, with math, the
          absolute bare minimum that you ought to know about how startup equity
          works. You won't walk out a finance guru, but at least you'll know
          what the words mean, and have a much better idea of what VCs and
          founders are talking about (what happens next will shock you!)

          phenomena tells us quite a bit about the symmetry found in our
          physiology and how our brain interprets it is fascinating. We’ll
          discover why certain instruments sound the way they do, and why some
          instruments are better suited for rhythm than percussion. We’ll also
          turn the room into a giant distributed synthesizer and make some
          noise.
