          But even we get it wrong sometimes. Here's a 10-step breakdown of
          what we do now (and how it differs from other hiring processes).

        description: Let’s talk about what a harmonic series is. This natural
          phenomena tells us quite a bit about the symmetry found in our
          physiology and how our brain interprets it is fascinating. We’ll
          discover why certain instruments sound the way they do, and why some
          instruments are better suited for rhythm than percussion. We’ll also
          turn the room into a giant distributed synthesizer and make some
          noise.

          new song, with very little code.
